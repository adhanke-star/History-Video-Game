# V1 FEATURE-COMPLETE CHECKLIST — "The Civil War"  (APPROVED — run-k Q&A, 2026-06-15)

**Purpose:** give "complete all project goals" a concrete, ordered target so autonomous runs can drive to a
content-complete v1 (still a perpetual project after — D54). Built from `MODERN-UGG-PLAN.md` (P0–P5),
`GRAND-STRATEGY-PLAN.md` (S2–S5), and the §8 charter systems. **Status: APPROVED** — all 12 forks across a
3-round Q&A are locked (recorded as DECISIONS **D61**). The phase order below is the roadmap for autonomous runs.

---

## OPERATING MODEL (LOCKED — run-k Q&A, 2026-06-15)
1. **Surface judgment calls.** Design/balance forks are surfaced for your approval BEFORE building; only
   mechanical/obvious continuations + the build-and-vet itself run autonomously. (Refines charter §8.3
   "decide & ship" — that applied to the all-night charter; you've now opted for design oversight.)
2. **Clear-then-continuous.** I clear a SCOPE's designs with you upfront, then execute the whole scope
   continuously (all-night style), pausing only at scope-end or when a NEW unforeseen fork appears.
3. **Per-milestone vetting + push** stays the same: GATE OK → focused probe + full no-regression + diag-classic
   + 0 pageerrors → adversarial bug-hunt (all fixed) → commit → `git push origin main`. Balance auto-tuned + logged.
4. **Content standard:** ≥2-source Verified (else Inferred), anti-Lost-Cause, period-but-tight voice.

## THE V1 CHECKLIST (proposed order — edit freely)

### Phase A — CONNECT THE TWO LAYERS  ‹✅ DONE — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D62›
- [x] **A1 Bridge conditioning into tactical:** the strategic-desk army (weapons bought, the 3 corps,
      general/leadership, morale, manpower strength) conditions the tactical battle's forces (strength /
      firepower / quality / morale / fatigue) — the owner-mode army you built actually fields in the real-time fight.
      *(`src/tactical/T2-campaign-link.js` `fldCampaignCondition`; 74-anchor ±12% identical to Classic/auto-resolve; re-arms from the loadout incl. reinforcements.)*
- [x] **A2 Tactical FREE mode:** a menu entry to launch a custom skirmish (pick side / forces / terrain) and
      to fight the Bull Run scenario from the bridge (not just the standalone demo).
      *("Fight in real time ⚔" on the bridge briefing; First Bull Run [US]→bullrun1 else a conditioned procedural fight; a "⚔ SKIRMISH" main-menu setup [side/size/ground/year/fog].)*
- [x] **A3 Result feedback loop:** the real-time battle outcome flows back into the campaign (casualties,
      ground, `enemyWill`) — substitutable for the existing Classic / auto-resolve result (MODERN-UGG §2).
      *(REAL casualty fractions from the fight → `startBattleRuntime`+`_arApplyCasualties`+`campaignAdvance`→`_t1Resolve`; win advances, loss recovers; deterministic. probe-campaign-link 16/16.)*

### Phase B — TACTICAL DEPTH  (P2–P5, real-time engine)  ‹✅ COMPLETE — B1 D64 · B2 D65 · B3 D66 · B4 D67 · B5 D70 · B6 D72 — run k, 2026-06-15/16›
- [x] **B1 Smarter ATTACKER AI** — defender-favored, fog aids the defender (LOCKED); attacker doctrinally
      sound (concentrate / assault) but the fog inversion tuned out. (Prototype exists: `ATTACKER-AI-PROPOSAL.md`.)
      *(`fldAiAttacker`: concentrate-on-weaker-flank / close / assault, GRADUAL per-unit commit [no knife-edge] + CAUTIOUS-WHEN-BLIND. Sweep: both-doctrines Bull Run fog-OFF CS 6/8, fog-ON 8/8 — fog aids the defender; def-cas 4592 vs the passive 1276. probe-ai 15/15.)*
- [x] **B2 Officers / command** — leaders with command radius + morale bonus, can be hit (ties named-generals). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D65›
      *(`src/tactical/T3-officers.js`: a command AURA [faster recovery / rally / capped rout-resistance] + an exposure→wound→fall hazard with a one-time command shock; per-leader HISTORICAL fate + risk-decay + cover so army commanders survive [10/10] and only the real casualties [Bee/Bartow] are fall-prone; ties `bridgeArmy` leadership; the real Bull Run cast in `data/bullrun.json`. Officers-ON Bull Run CS 7/8 fog-OFF · 8/8 fog-ON. probe-officers 15/15; 6 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B3 In-battle logistics** — ammo + fatigue depth + supply. ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D66›
      *(`src/tactical/T4-logistics.js`: rear ammunition trains w/ finite reserve, disengaged-resupply, out-of-ammo→bayonet on the objective, exhaustion move penalty; attacker-far/defender-near train asymmetry. **Bug-hunt caught a fog inversion** [logistics-ON inverted fog-aids-defender, CS 8/8→0/8]; surfaced to Aaron → fixed by choking the ATTACKER's resupply under fog → balance-NEUTRAL both fog states [fog-OFF CS 5/8, fog-ON CS 8/8]. Ties strategic supply + raid. probe-logistics 14/14; 7 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B4 Distinct arm roles** — artillery (canister / long-range), cavalry (scout / flank / screen / raid). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D67›
      *(`src/tactical/T5-arms.js`: canister spike vs cover-attenuation + long-range bombardment; the ASYMMETRIC battery doctrine [defender-safe / attacker-forward-and-catchable, the lost crest guns]; the ARM melee table [art 0.35 overrun, cav 1.4 shock / 0.9 braced]; cavalry scout/flank/screen/raid [raid drains the enemy B-3 train]; the Cannon-Corps→field-battery bridge [`_fldArtProfile`: Napoleon→canister, Whitworth→long-range]. **Vetting caught a real byte-identity bug** [the base.html `ARM` melee table was live, not undefined → fixed via a base-ARM fallback when arms off] and **surfaced a stacked-balance fork** [officers+logistics+arms made clear-weather AI-vs-AI Union-favoured; Aaron's call → **First Bull Run now DEFAULTS to fog ON**, the faithful battle where fog aids the defender → live CS 8/8]. arms-only fog-OFF CS 7/8. probe-arms 23/23; 8 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B5 Difficulty/realism presets** for the AI + sim depth. **Exposes the effectiveness/realism sliders the
      TACTICAL ENGINEERING CORPS effects will key off** (the Engineering Corps stays its OWN later milestone, D69 — B5
      ships the sliders + hooks, not the corps). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-16, DECISIONS D70›
      *(`src/tactical/T6-presets.js`: AI tier [Recruit/Regular/Veteran/Hardee] × realism bundle [Arcade/Balanced/Historian]
      + an Advanced per-lever expander, read at `fldInitSim` → `__FIELD.sev`{attrition·canister·supply·cmdShock·sight·veteran}
      + aiSkill/aiResolve/aiCushion → wires the existing B-1..B-4 knobs [mostly wiring, not new sim]. SMARTER-NOT-CHEATING,
      code-enforced: aiResolve ≤1 [never an enemy buff], the player cushion ONLY at a genuine Recruit, Hardee = sharper
      decisions not stat bonuses. **Balanced == today's shipped CS 8/8 SEED-FOR-SEED [byte-identical neutral].** Period-card
      "Command & Realism" picker + an in-battle "⚙ Settings" drawer; WCAG-AA, CVD-safe, reduceMotion, deterministic.
      Bug-hunt 76 agents → 13 confirmed + 6 critic gaps ALL fixed [drawer-Escape-tore-down-battle, picker ARIA, a
      malformed-preset clamp, the fog-scenario V-toggle wipe, …]. probe-presets 26/26; 9 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B6 CS-player tactical mode** ‹LOCKED: yes, Phase B› — command EITHER side in a battle (you defend as
      the CS, AI attacks). Makes the attacker AI (B1) player-facing. Doubles tactical replayability. ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-16, DECISIONS D72›
      *(`src/tactical/T7-command-side.js` + seams in T0/T1/T3: `__FIELD.playerSide` authoritative [opts/skirmish/`_fldCamp().side`/US];
      the control layer + the render/HUD FOG VIEWER + the friend/foe line generalized from literal "US" to `fldPlayerSide()`; `fldBrSpec`
      flips the scenario AI flags by side [a CS player DEFENDS; attacker stays US → faces the B-1 AI]; a period side-choice card + side-aware
      briefing/objective/end-"you"-line + a player-home-edge 3D camera. **Vetting caught + fixed a CS-campaign officer/fog regression**
      [fldPlayerSide must resolve a CS campaign LIVE from G.campaign.side]; bug-hunt 52 agents → 11 confirmed + 7 critic gaps, the HIGH
      [skirmish-rematch soft-lock] + 3 MED [side-aware camera · fog-leak reinforcement cue · a render-fog probe gap] + LOW polish all fixed.
      Byte-identical for US; CS defense winnable 8/8 fog-ON; live stacked still CS 8/8. probe-csplayer 16/16; 10 baselines byte-identical.)*

### Phase C — TACTICAL BREADTH  (more real-time battles, data-driven)
- [x] **C1 Eastern marquee (COMPLETE):** ~~Fredericksburg~~ ✅ (D73). ~~Universal artillery gun model~~ ✅ (D75). ~~Antietam~~ ✅ (D76 — first multi-phase epic, bug-hunt later completed in repo history). ~~Gettysburg~~ ✅ (multi-phase Day 1/2/3 scenario present, probe-gettysburg 16/16 after the 2026-06-18 HUD/assertion refresh). ~~Chancellorsville~~ ✅ (Jackson's flank march, single-phase Fredericksburg/Shiloh pattern; data/chancellorsville.json + registry + menu rank 35; 2026-06-18). ~~Malvern Hill~~ ✅ (Seven Days artillery duel, single-phase gun-line defense; data/malvern-hill.json + registry/menu rank 18; probe-malvern-hill 24/24; 2026-06-18). Current roster/order/side-choice/launch contracts are guarded by `tools/probe-tactical-roster.mjs` (D80/D82).
- [~] **C2 Western** ‹LOCKED: Phase C, with breadth›: ~~Shiloh~~ ✅ (first Western theater battle, single-phase Fredericksburg-pattern scenario; probe-shiloh 29/29). ~~Vicksburg~~ ✅ (the river-fortress SIEGE as a 3-phase battle — Stockade Redan → Forlorn Hope → the Saps & the Mine; data/vicksburg.json + registry/menu rank 55; probe-vicksburg 18/18; the May assaults now cost the attacker, the siege wins, the city falls; D86). ~~Chickamauga~~ ✅ (the bloodiest Western battle as a 3-phase epic — the Woods [Sep 19, the line holds] → Longstreet's Breakthrough [Sep 20, the Brotherton gap, the decisive scoreWeight-3 phase] → the Rock of Chickamauga [Thomas holds Snodgrass Hill / Horseshoe Ridge]; top-level attacker=CS/defender=US; data/chickamauga.json + registry/menu rank 60; probe-chickamauga 18/18; aggregate CS 32/32 with the Wood-gap alt-history hinge + the costly-victory teaching; contingency-over-genius + squandered-victory anti-Lost-Cause frame; Harker corrected to Colonel by the bug-hunt; D90). Remaining: **Chattanooga** (the US-offensive reversal — Orchard Knob → Lookout Mountain → Missionary Ridge; design brief at `.tmp/chattanooga-design.md`), then Atlanta/the March, Franklin.
- [ ] **C3 USCT battles (1863–65):** the Crater, New Market Heights, Olustee, Nashville (the flagship teachable arc).
- [x] **C4 Custom-battle builder** (D54/D84): single-phase V1 tactical scenario authoring UI, validation, export/shareable JSON, import/round-trip, six local slots, explicit `custom_...` launch contract through `fldScenarioInit`, and focused/no-regression probes. Phase authoring remains deferred until a phase editor can be proven safely.

### Phase D — FULL HEX TACTICAL ENGINE  ‹⏸ DEFERRED TO v2 — D91 (the real-time engine is mature; a parallel hex engine is no longer a v1 requirement)›
- [ ] **D1** A complete parallel hex/turn-based tactical mode on the modern OOB/scenario data, selectable per
      battle alongside real-time. (Legacy "Classic" hex battles stay frozen; this is a NEW, data-driven hex layer.)
      ‹LOCKED: sits here, after tactical depth, so it duplicates onto a mature engine.›

### Phase E — STRATEGIC ARC COMPLETION  (S3–S5)  ‹▶ NEXT after C breadth — D91 (pulled ahead of the hex engine; the biggest content-thin pillar)›
- [x] **E1 S3 alt-history:** tiered divergence + hinge forks + emergent toggle + the player-driven "your war
      vs history" tracker + divergence log (no thumb on the scale — D54). ‹✅ COMPLETE through D118.›
      ‹✅ increment 1 (D111): the flagship **"Your War vs History"** desk tab — a tiered (minor/major/radical),
      dated DIVERGENCE LEDGER with the historical counterfactual per entry + a 0..100 divergence INDEX + the
      EMERGENT-ONLY toggle (withholds the wild-card gambits). Pure read-out over the S1e `C.strategy` seeds
      (`src/81-divergence.js`; no tactical file touched → combat byte-identical). Detects emancipation timing
      [declined/early/1862/late], CS arm-the-enslaved, foreign recognition, the 1864 election (US) / CS
      home-front break, the CS trajectory, each wild card. probe-divergence 14/14; bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE.
      ‹✅ increment 2 (D115): **ALTERNATE ENDINGS — the fantastical tier** (Aaron's D114 catalog, build-order
      pick). 8 fantastical alt-history end-states (4/side: A British war · Maximilian's legions · Stonewall lives ·
      the Golden Circle; the rapid-fire war · a Russo-American century · Lincoln lives Reconstruction · the 13th
      early), each EARNED (a gambit/emancipation/victory `precond` OPENS it, a `vicMomentum`/recognition/election
      `gate` SECURES it → ★ Reached / ◇ Within reach + a secure-hint). New `src/83-endings.js`
      (`_END_CATALOG`/`endScan`/`endRenderSection`); surfaced in the "Your War vs History" tab + the after-action
      report via guarded embeds; pure read-out, no tactical file → combat byte-identical. probe-endings 9/9;
      bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE (all 8 counterfactuals verified; 2 fixed). The Golden Circle named honestly,
      anti-Lost-Cause.›
      ‹✅ increment 3 (D116): **the GROUNDED tier — CS-half** (8 plausible/long-shot Confederate end-states, the
      D114 catalog: Recognized independence · Negotiated peace · Emancipated Confederacy [slavery named plainly] ·
      Stalemate/two-Americas · Fabian survival · Trans-Miss redoubt · King Cotton coerces Europe · Northwest
      secedes), authored the same way in `_END_CATALOG` + the new `_endEnemyWill`/`_endYear`/`_endLever` accessors;
      `endRenderSection` rewritten into a CVD-safe LABELED SPECTRUM (Plausible → Long shot → Fantastical bands).
      Pure read-out → battles byte-identical. probe-endings 16/16; bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE (4 confirmed + 2
      critic-LOW fixed: the trans-miss passage-of-time open, the US teaser over-promise, the Fabian fortify-ports
      opener, the negotiated-peace hint, + reachability/coverage).›
      ‹✅ increment 4 (D117): **the GROUNDED tier — US-half** (the 8 Union end-states, the D114 catalog:
      Reconstruction-that-holds · Early abolition [the `us-radical-emanc` WILD, not the auto-tripping usctUnlocked] ·
      Hard-war collapse · Reunion-without-emancipation [named as the moral failure it would have been, NOT a triumph] ·
      1862 knockout [year≤1862 & won≥5] · Forty-acres [Foner/Du Bois] · Compensated-bloodless [em.year≤1862; Lincoln] ·
      the general strike [Du Bois]), authored the same way in `_END_CATALOG`; the US teaser flipped so BOTH sides now
      advertise the full labeled spectrum. **The labeled grounded→fantastical spectrum is now complete on both sides —
      24/24 of the D114 catalog's end-states live (12 CS + 12 US).** Pure read-out → battles byte-identical.
      probe-endings 24/24 (+8 D117 steps); bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE (8 agents; 1 confirmed MED fixed — the
      general-strike USCT count corrected from "tens of thousands" to ~180,000, matching the game's own after-action
      figure). wcag-auditor AA (data-only, no edits).›
      ‹✅ increment 5 (D118): **interactive HINGE-FORK decision cards** on the proven `decResolve`/`_decApply`
      engine (pure data → byte-identical by construction). 4 citation-grade strategic forks (2 US, 2 CS) that
      STEER the war's trajectory toward the ending spectrum: us-hard-war (total war/conciliation/grind → hard-war
      collapse) · us-reconstruction-terms (10% Plan/Wade-Davis/forty-acres → Reconstruction-that-holds) ·
      cs-king-cotton (embargo/export/burn → recognized independence/King Cotton) · cs-peace-feelers
      (negotiate/fight-on/husband → negotiated peace/Fabian). All `trigger.hinge` with the rich multi-voice `card`
      block + a named-and-countered Lost-Cause myth voice; deck 8 → 12. Cards use only the existing `_decApply`
      vocabulary (move momentum [the dominant ending gate] + foreign/blockade/manpower); each option's prose names
      the ending it steers toward. probe-decisions 19/19 (+5 D118 steps); research+verify (8 agents) + bug-hunt
      (6 agents) invariantsHold=TRUE, 0 confirmed; wcag-auditor auto-fixed 2 PRE-EXISTING AA contrast failures in
      the decision render. (The wild/lever/recognition openers stay on the Paths-to-Victory surface, by design.)›
      ‹✅ the divergence-log read-back landed in the E4 graded after-action report (D112).››
- [ ] **E2 S4 education:** multi-axis codex + inline glossary + the full guided tutorial + play-style presets
      (President / General-Commander, + the Historian settings overlay — D39) + difficulty/realism sliders.
      ‹build order (D120): i1 codex DATA+tab → i2 inline glossary → i3 tutorial → i4 presets+Historian overlay → i5 sliders.›
      ‹✅ increment 1 (D120): the multi-axis **CODEX/glossary** — `data/codex.json` (60 citation-grade, anti-Lost-Cause
      entries across 4 axes: people 24 · units 11 · terms 19 · systems 6; all Verified, ≥2 real sources) + a searchable,
      axis-filterable, cross-linked **Codex** President's-Desk tab (`src/84-codex.js`, pure read-out → battles byte-identical)
      + `cxLookupShort`/`cxGlossaryIndex` for the i2 inline glossary. Content via a 14-agent research+verify Workflow (the
      verify pass caught + fixed a fabricated artillery cite and the Forrest-founded-the-Klan error → "first Grand Wizard").
      probe-codex 18/18 (incl. a static-scan that no combat path reads the codex); 26-agent bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE,
      16 LOW/MED findings all fixed + probe-locked; wcag-auditor AA (2 contrast spans fixed).›
      ‹✅ increment 2 (D121): the **INLINE GLOSSARY** — `src/93-glossary.js` DOM-decorates the teaching prose of the
      After-Action + Your-War-vs-History tabs, wrapping codex terms in accessible inline `<button>` triggers (dotted brass
      underline) + a shared tooltip; reads the SAME codex data (`cxGlossaryIndex`/`cxLookupShort`). Matchers built from
      DERIVED SURFACES (strip "The"/"(...)", extract acronyms like USCT, + 3 bare-form aliases) so prose forms match; the
      def rides each trigger's aria-label (SR on focus; tooltip aria-hidden). Pure read-out, guarded `_wdRefresh` hook →
      battles byte-identical. probe-glossary 12/12 (+static-scan); OFFLINE 26-agent bug-hunt fixed a real word-boundary bug
      (parenthetical terms were dead matchers) + 15 more, all probe-locked; wcag AA. ⚠ committed LOCALLY, push HELD
      (Aaron paused internet mid-run).›
- [ ] **E3 S4 accessibility:** the dedicated FULL WCAG 2.2 AA pass + the 4 a11y modes (high-contrast, CVD-safe,
      SR turn/battle narration, dyslexia font) — your professional bar.
- [x] **E4 S5 victory:** multiple honest paths incl. negotiated peace + the rich graded after-action report +
      the Reconstruction coda. ‹✅ COMPLETE through D119.›
      ‹✅ increment 1 (D112): **the rich GRADED AFTER-ACTION REPORT** — an A–F report card (D94 scale, neutral
      64=C, CVD triple-encoded) across 6 domains (Battlefield · Treasury · Diplomacy/Blockade · Home Front & the
      1864 election · the war's PURPOSE [US=emancipation timing; CS=an honest NON-graded "Confederate Cause"
      panel, anti-Lost-Cause] · High Command) + a headline overall grade + a **read-back of the D111 divergence
      ledger** (`divScan`/`divIndex`) + the human cost vs the ~750k historical toll (Hacker 2011) + a forward
      **Reconstruction coda** keyed to the emancipation choice (Foner). Surfaced as a live **"After-Action"** desk
      tab (16th, pure read-out) AND the war-end final report (the authorized `warWonScreen` override). New
      `src/82-after-action.js`; no tactical file touched → combat byte-identical by construction. probe-afteraction
      10/10; bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE (1 LOW + 2 critic-LOW, one NaN root cause, fixed+probe-locked); wcag AA.
      ‹✅ the §12.3 ELECTION-SUPPORT RELIEF-BIND shipped (D113): a commissioned UNION political general costs extra
      political capital to relieve before the 1864 vote (rises 1862<1863<1864, relaxes once `resolved1864`); a
      teaching tell on the active-general card; UNION-only + byte-identical for the roster + the CS side;
      probe-command 76/76; bug-hunt 3 confirmed (2 MED + 1 LOW) all fixed.›
      ‹✅ increment 2 (D119): **E4-i2 — THE STRATEGIC WAR-END.** A reached `victoryReady` (a negotiated peace /
      a recognized independence) now CONCLUDES the war through the same D112 graded report, surfaced as a NON-FORCED
      offer on the between-battles interstitial ("The war can be concluded", or fight on) — the war-end fires for a
      non-chain-complete victory. New helpers in `src/82-after-action.js` (`aarStrategicEndAvailable`/`aarConcludeWar`
      + the `warWonScreen` framing); side-correct ("recognition" CS-only — the Union never wins by the South's
      recognition; "will" side-aware; a CS victory framed honestly, never valorized). Byte-identical interstitial when
      no offer; byte-identical D112 screen at chain completion; no tactical file → battles byte-identical. probe-
      afteraction 15/15 (+5 D119); bug-hunt invariantsHold=TRUE (1 LOW + 2 critic [1 MED side-aware-toast + 1 LOW]
      all fixed+probe-locked); wcag AA. The honest multi-path victory framing is the graded report (D112).›

### Phase F — CONTENT SYSTEMS  (folded into the phase each best fits)
- [ ] Logistics/rail network · POW exchange-collapse · disease/medical · hard war · irregular war · the four
      under-told-perspective threads · flagship named units · CS finance toolkit · war-finance civics · a real
      diplomacy system · the human-cost-with-gravity treatment. (All from §8 D31–D41.)
- [ ] **Women in the war — soldier & relief threads (Aaron, run-k idea, 2026-06-15).** Add **female leads in the
      soldier-story rotation**, not only male: the women who enlisted **disguised as men** (est. several hundred —
      e.g. Sarah Rosetta Wakeman / "Pvt. Lyons Wakeman", Jennie Hodgers / "Albert Cashier" [served the whole war,
      drew a pension], Loreta Janeta Velázquez / "Harry T. Buford" on the CS side — frame the contested memoir as
      contested), and a **Clara Barton arc** (the "Angel of the Battlefield" → the Missing Soldiers Office → the
      American Red Cross). Neighbors: **Dr. Mary Edwards Walker** (the only woman awarded the Medal of Honor) and
      **Harriet Tubman** (scout/spy; the Combahee River Raid, 1863). Verified/anti-Lost-Cause; ties USCT (C3) +
      the human-cost treatment. ‹idea — implement when soldier-stories / the codex land; not B-4 scope›
- [x] **Tactical Engineering Corps — units, features & effects tied to the effectiveness/realism sliders (Aaron,
      run-k directive, 2026-06-15; "all of the above" locked 2026-06-20, D87) — ✅ COMPLETE (all 3 increments, D87–D89).** Built as `src/tactical/T13-engineering.js`

      shallow ford [slow] / deep ford [needs a bridge above Arcade] / player-laid pontoon [fast]; the B-5 slider scales
      sapper speed, ford slow, AND fordable-vs-requires-pontoon; the strategic Engineer Works Corps `bridgeArmy.engineering`

      documented future extension). AI river-pathing / AI-built works is the named T13 extension point.
      Extend the strategic **Engineer Works Corps** (`src/57-engineering.js`, D43;
      `bridgeArmy(C).engineering`) onto the real-time field as a distinct arm/role (the same gated-seam pattern
      B-4 used for art/cav): **pontoon bridges** (cross a creek/river — the Bull Run terrain already has
      Young's Branch / the Stone Bridge), **field fortifications / entrenchments** (raise cover on the objective),
      **abatis / obstacles** (slow an assault), **obstacle-clearing / road & railhead repair** (restore movement).
      **The "make it make sense" requirement: these effects must INTERACT with the B-5 effectiveness/realism
      sliders** — e.g. the realism preset scales how long entrenching takes, how much cover a parapet confers,
      whether pontoons are required to cross vs. fordable, sapper speed, and how the strategic engineering rating
      gates the field corps' size/quality (the A1-bridge anchor, like B-4 wired Cannon-Corps→battery). Surface a
      concrete design when B-5 / a tactical-engineering milestone is reached. ‹idea + B-5 wiring requirement›

### Phase G — THEATERS
- [ ] Eastern (largely done) → **Western** (same mechanics, new content — D40/D54). Naval/riverine/trans-Miss DEFERRED.

### Phase H — "MAKE IT COME TO LIFE"  (graphics/footage — LOCKED: AFTER gameplay-complete)
- [ ] **H1 PD images:** weapons / flags / USCT / scenes (have 131 portraits) via LoC + Internet Archive +
      Wikimedia, linked-assets + offline fallback. **Asset-ingestion (D71):** extend `tools/build.mjs` (Node, not a
      separate script) to Base64-embed + TIER/COMPRESS media w/ offline fallback so the single file stays portable as
      it grows (D68 #7). **Guardrail (D71):** no Phase-H media lib may require `SharedArrayBuffer` (COOP/COEP headers
      can't be set on GitHub Pages; `coi-serviceworker` is the shim if ever needed). PD imagery > AI art (aesthetic / IP / anachronism).
- [~] **H1b Brigade BADGES & INSIGNIA — the battle flags (Aaron, run-k idea, 2026-06-15).** Render each brigade's
      identity with its **battle flag / colors** on the unit badge: the various Confederate battle flags (ANV
      Southern Cross, Hardee/Polk Western patterns, the national flags), the U.S. national & regimental colors,
      and the **Army of the Potomac corps badges** (Kearny patch, the corps shapes/colors). Tasteful period
      engraving on the 2D/3D unit markers + the selected-brigade HUD; CVD-safe (shape + label, not flag-color
      alone); honor reduceMotion. Pairs with the B-4 arm markers (gun/limber + trooper) already shipped.
      ‹partial: `src/tactical/T10-flags.js` shipped unit flags/insignia; 2026-06-18 follow-up replaced the 3D SVG TextureLoader warning path with cached canvas-backed `CanvasTexture` maps and disposal hooks. `tools/probe-tactical-visuals.mjs` now fails on the known Three.js texture warning and passes with `textureWarnings:0`. Broader Phase-H visual polish remains open.›
- [ ] **H2 Reenactment footage** cutaways at key beats (skippable, offline→procedural fallback).
- [~] **H3 Richer 3D/animation** on the tactical engine (reuse run-h PBR/HDRI/post-FX); period broadsheet/engraving UI throughout.
      ‹partial: 2026-06-19 D85 adds a procedural 3D objective beacon to the live tactical engine and extends `tools/probe-tactical-visuals.mjs` to 8 captures with beacon-coordinate assertions. Broader H3 rendering/animation/readability work remains open.›
- [~] **H4 Richer audio** ‹LOCKED: Phase H›: PD period tunes + battlefield/camp soundscapes + UI cues, all
      accessible (toggles/captions/volume), default off. ‹partial: `src/tactical/T9-audio.js` / audio work exists in recent repo history; full Phase-H polish still pending.›

### Phase I — LOOT / SURVIVAL + "THE SOLDIER'S STORY"  ‹⭐ CORE PILLAR — D91 (loot) + D93 (the character/journey layer)›
- [ ] Standalone rarity-tiered loot + inventory (all modes) · light survival (rations/weather/forage/disease,
      default off) · the Oregon-Trail journey mode. All preset-gated (§27).
- [ ] **"The Soldier's Story" (D93, Aaron) — build AFTER the C+E roadmap; unified with the journey mode above.**
      An EA-Sports-style **prosopography DB** — *every identifiable individual* (granularity = exhaustive) with
      **bio, stats/ratings, character history, portrait, team (army→corps→division→brigade→regiment→company)** — +
      a **play-as-anyone whole-war mode**: pick any person, choose when+where to start, proceed from their **REAL
      rank/position**, then play forward into alt-history. Bottom-up build: (1) granular OOB + per-person/regiment
      **detail cards** (DATA, reuses teaching cards, NO engine change — brigades stay one marker per the D68
      zoom-deferral) → (2) codex **person/unit axis** (Phase E/S4) → (3) the **playthrough mode** (career/trajectory
      model + start-anywhere engine) → (4) **interpersonal/romance** (women-in-the-war / USCT / immigrant hooks;
      period-honest, anti-Lost-Cause). **Hard prereq: accurate rank+position+unit per person — the D92 roster
      hardening is its first roster data.** (Memory `civilwar-soldiers-story-pillar`; DECISIONS D93.)
- [~] **The RATING SYSTEM / "Madden layer" (D94) — the cross-cutting substrate this pillar is built on.** Design law: `RATING-SYSTEM-DESIGN.md`; increments R-0→R-6 (§9). Pulled AHEAD of Chattanooga (D94 fork 1). Shipped: **R-0** the data spine (`data/ratings.json` + `src/tactical/T14-ratings.js` pure fns + `tools/probe-ratings.mjs`; byte-identical) ✅; **R-1** officer derivation into the command + field pipes — persona→`gen.skill` (9 strategic-general personas, exact calibration) + persona→officer `quality`/`radius`/`fate` (explicit-`pid` opt-in, Bull Run cast) ✅ (D95); **R-2** the OVR read-out UI — A–F report-card grade on the Command desk (active card + appoint pool) + a tactical-HUD brigade-OVR line; pure display, byte-identical, WCAG-AA + CVD triple-encode ✅ (D96); **R-3** the badge engine (the first rating→combat seam) — guarded `fldBadgeFactor(u,lever)` (fire/rally/speed/melee) + the cohesion rally term + the realism-scaled per-lever stacking cap + the no-fudge OUTPUT-WALL build-gate (dot+bracket); ships the Star/Superstar positives + the Verified negatives (Slows/Piecemeal/Rigid/Green/Powder-Shy); badges-off byte-identical (proven across sandbox + 9 battles) ✅ (D97; vetted via a domcontentloaded byte-identity harness — the standard `load` suite was env-blocked by the THREE-CDN headless stall, see D97/HANDOFF); **R-4** the X-FACTORS (the dramatic "in the zone" surge, inside the no-fudge wall) — `fldXFactorStep`/`fldXFactorApplyCmd` (one-channel surge per badge: NON-speed→capped cmdBonus toward the 0.9 wall, SPEED→`_spdMul` [0.85,1.15]) + the combined-speed clamp [0.75,1.30] + a CVD-safe vector-bolt `_xfGlow` + a one-shot ⚡ announce; realism-scaled (arcade 1.45/balanced 1.20/historian 1.08); added Forrest's `first_with_the_most` (7 X-Factors); X-Factor-off byte-identical (proven 10/10 vs committed R-3); the no-fudge REPLAY GATE shows the surge BITES (flipped a US→CS win) yet bounded (17.2% delta) + capped (maxCmd 0.47); bug-hunt 23 agents → 7 latent findings all fixed ✅ (D98; vetted via the byte-identity harness, `load` still intermittently env-blocked); **Q7** the GM MATCHUP layer (the read-out payoff, §13/§14) — the **dual Attack/Defend OVR** on the Command desk (`_cmdGenDualOVR`: headline + ATK/DEF split, persona-tilt when rated / generals.json aggression-caution else; pills on the active card + appoint pool) + the **pre-battle matchup screen** on the side-choice card (`fldMatchupHtml`/`fldMatchupBoard`/`fldOOBSideOVR`: each army's force OVR + strength + commander + a labeled predicted-edge bar from the OOB); pure display, byte-identical (10/10 vs committed R-4), WCAG-AA 0 failures; multi-phase battles scoped to the **OPENING engagement** (anti-Lost-Cause fix — the all-phase sum had falsely favoured the CS at Gettysburg); bug-hunt 21 agents → 3 confirmed + 1 HIGH critic all fixed ✅ (D99); **Q8** the between-battle CAMP LOOP (§15) — a new "Camp" desk tab: DRILL the army (4 foci toward a ceiling, fatigue-limited; or DELEGATE) + PROGRESSION read-out (the general's reputation→OVR growth); `src/36-camp.js` (campInit/campDrill/campSetDelegate/campTrainingBonus[the bridge seam]/campOnResolve) feeds `bridgeArmy` a guarded bounded lift (musketry→firepower/maneuver→morale/entrenching→supply/endurance→fatigue + overall sharpness, ≤~8 overall); **byte-identical until the player ENGAGES the camp** (the `engaged` gate — proven: probe-camp keystone + bridge/conditioning 6/6 unchanged + byte-identity 10/10 vs Q7); combat seasons by casualty SHARE (win-up / bled-lion's-share-down); rides the save, no _SAVE_VER bump; bug-hunt 21 agents → 1 MED (the bloody dimensional bug — win-seasoning was dead) + 4 critic all fixed; wcag 0 ✅ (D100); **R-5** the PROSOPOGRAPHY SCALE-OUT (§5/§8/§9 — the D93 substrate) — a brigade carries ONE recomputable `fldMenMeanOVR` (O(1), no N-row build); `fldMaterializePerson` builds exactly one person row on demand + `fldBrigadeMuster` a HARD-CAPPED (≤6) muster sample (a 100,000-man brigade → 3 rows — the lazy-materialization invariant); generated rows get a deterministic synth period name + Inferred provenance + a `latentCommand` seed; `fldPromotePerson` is the latent-command **play-as-anyone** promotion (pure); `fldPersonTeam` the EA-style journey hook; `fldProvenanceStyle` makes Inferred (HATCHED) visually distinct from Verified (SOLID), CVD-safe; live-wired as a guarded **MEN OVR** HUD line beside the R-2 combat OVR; byte-identical (10/10 vs committed HEAD), probe-ratings 19/19, wcag 0; bug-hunt 11 agents → 2 confirmed + 2 critic (all LOW/latent) all fixed (defensive copies vs future career-write aliasing) ✅ (D101); **Q9** the GM PROMOTION economy (the first depth-chart MOVE, §12.2/§14.3) — a Command-desk "officer corps — promotions" section: `cmdPromote` raises a general one grade up a clean ladder (Brig.→Maj.→Lt. Gen.→General, parsed from the verbose `generals.json` rank by `_cmdBaseGrade`) spending a **multi-currency** budget (political capital `C.clock.capital` + a NEW `cmd.seniority` pool that accrues over the campaign, capped) gated on BOTH, **merit-gated** by reputation (EARNED → +confidence; ABOVE-merit → ×1.8 capital + a jealousy rep HIT that can LOWER his OVR — rank ≠ competence, anti-Lost-Cause) with a leapfrog seniority surcharge; reaches the fight ONLY via a small BOUNDED skill lift (`_cmdPromoteSkillLift` ≤6 → the EDITED `_cmdEffectiveSkill(gen,C)` → `_cmdGenRating` → `commandLeadership` → the bridge — an INPUT, never the scoreboard); **byte-identical until the player promotes** (0 lift un-promoted; proven 10/10 vs committed HEAD `fc1d251` + a live sanity: promotes "Lt. Gen.", lead 79→80, un-promoted identical); all in `src/35-command.js` + a `promotion` config in `data/ratings.json`, rides the save (no `_SAVE_VER` bump); `probe-command` 25/25, wcag 0 AA failures; bug-hunt 7 Opus agents → 2 confirmed + 1 critic (ALL LOW/latent, 0 HIGH/MED; critic "SOUND, may commit") all fixed (capital gate/spend one-lens; unrecognized-rank fallback → lowest grade; load-clamp a tampered seniority) ✅ (D102); **R-6 (citation-provenance portion)** the CATALOG-WIDE citation hardening — an audit found **47 records across 6 data files** stamped `Verified` with <2 sources (badges 13 · personas 2 · weapons 9 · artillery 9 · engineering 8 · terrain 1 · cabinet 5); a 15-agent research+verify Workflow (web-checked, 0 fabrication) gave each ≥2 independent real sources, and a permanent build-gate (`tools/build.mjs` 4e, trim/case-normalized on either prov key, masking-proof) now FAILS the build on any `Verified`-with-<2; `beloved` held Inferred (Freeman held out as Lost-Cause-tinged), `grand_charge` upgraded Verified, `feared` de-Lost-Caused (Wyeth 1899→Hurst 1993); byte-identical sim (10/10 vs HEAD `5b12916`, no combat field touched), `probe-ratings` 20/20 + the catalog-invariant step, bug-hunt 34 agents → 1 MED + 15 LOW (all latent), the MED [gate strict-equality evasion] + key LOWs fixed, critic "SAFE TO COMMIT" ✅ (D103); **R-6 roster badge ASSIGNMENT** — 43 documented +/− commander/unit traits stamped onto the 9 battles' brigades via a central `data/ratings.json` `rosterBadges` map (`fldBrSpec`→`fldMakeUnit`, byte-identical when off; byte-identity 30/30 off==HEAD + 0 winner-flips-against-history; all 9 per-battle probes green WITH badges on — Pickett repulsed, Burnside breaks, the Rock holds; anti-Lost-Cause CS 12:6:4 / US 11:10;

**byte-identical for an unassigned general** (the literal pre-D105 clamp [5,98], proven across all 5 outcome quadrants + both rails); accurate-inputs never an output gate (build-gate 4d now scans `35-command.js`); anti-Lost-Cause (the Union elite are RISERS rated as high as Lee/Jackson — Grant/Sherman/Sheridan/Thomas; failures named both sides — McClellan plateau, Burnside/Hooker overpromoted, Bragg quarrelsome, Hood volatile); a Command-desk "Career Arc" read-out; `probe-command` 34/34, `probe-ratings` 21/21 (tactical untouched, byte-identical by construction), bug-hunt 29-agent SAFE (1 HIGH citation + 10 lower all fixed), wcag AA ✅ (D105) — **R-6 is now feature-complete**. **[OOB-MAPPING SUBSTRATE DONE — D106]** the shared blocker for the GM depth-chart MOVES + Q8b scouting: `src/tactical/T15-oob.js` (`fldCampaignOOB`/`fldOOBForSide`/`fldCampaignOOBHtml`) maps the strategic next-battle → a structured **commander→corps→brigade** OOB tree for both sides (authored real OOB where a scenario exists, else a deterministic Inferred derivation with **no fabricated officers**, D92/#4); a read-only **"Order of Battle"** roster board on the Command desk (player EXACT, enemy FUZZY — scouting deepens via a `reveal` tier); byte-identical (pure read, **0 removed lines vs HEAD `7df4372`**; build-gate 4d scans T15); bug-hunt 15-agent (1 HIGH phase-framing anti-Lost-Cause [the Q7 failure resurfacing at the display layer] + 4 MED, ALL fixed); `probe-oob` 14/14; full no-regression GREEN ✅ (D106); **Q8b** the between-battle cavalry **RECONNAISSANCE** (§15) — an "Order a reconnaissance" control on the D106 Order-of-Battle board spends political capital (`C.clock.capital`) to tier-reveal the **enemy** OOB via `fldCampaignOOBHtml`'s `reveal` param, scaled by the **appointed general's persona `cavalry`** (light unscouted → better [named commander + per-corps grade + posture, cav < 65] → full [the complete enemy OOB, cav ≥ 65]); the WRITE `cmdScout` (`35-command.js`) writes ONLY `cmd.scout` + capital (keyed to the next-battle id, fresh per engagement, save-sanitized, no `_SAVE_VER` bump), T15 stays a pure read-out (`_fldOOBSideScouted` "better"-tier renderer + `_fldScoutPosture`, honoring `C.flipAtk`); **byte-identical combat** (no combat path reads `cmd.scout`; all 10 battle probes unchanged); teaches cavalry-as-eyes (Stuart's rides; the Gettysburg intelligence vacuum); `probe-oob` 15/15 + `probe-command` 40/40, bug-hunt 9-agent invariantsHold (1 LOW rounding + 1 LOW flipAtk-posture fixed), wcag AA (1 contrast fix) ✅ (D107); **Q10** the CORPS DEPTH-CHART (the GM depth-chart MOVE, §12.1/§12.2/§12.4) — a Command-desk "The Corps Command — Depth Chart" section: `cmdSeatCorps`/`cmdVacateCorps` seat pool generals into the army's I–IV Corps billets (`cmd.corps`) spending `seatCost` political capital; each seated corps commander adds a small BOUNDED lift to `commandLeadership` (`_cmdCorpsLift` = clamp(Σ(effRating−64)×0.05, ±4)) — an INPUT, never the scoreboard (build-gate 4d scans 35-command.js + T15); **byte-identical until a corps is seated** (lift 0; a vacant billet = 0, NOT a penalty; proven by a 132-cell A/B vs HEAD `2d11bd7`); the grade-fit is **side-aware** (US corps = Maj. Gen., CS corps = Lt. Gen. — the CS Sept-1862 Lt. Gen. grade for Longstreet/Jackson) so only CS Stuart seats below grade until Promoted (the Q9 synergy); one corps per general, the army commander can't double-hold, `cmdInit` sanitizes on load; seated commanders NAME the player's derived corps on the OOB board (pure display, edge unchanged, enemy + Garrison node never named); `data/ratings.json` `corpsCommand` (Inferred + 2 sources); `probe-command` 49/49 + `probe-oob` 16/16, bug-hunt 11-agent invariantsHold (3 confirmed [1 MED seat-log wording + 2 LOW Garrison-guard/citation-date] all fixed), wcag AA (3 contrast fixes) ✅ (D108); **Q11** the COMMISSION move (the GM "bring a new officer into the pool" row, §12.2/§12.3) — the President COMMISSIONS the documented POLITICAL GENERALS (US Banks/Butler/Sigel/McClernand, CS Floyd/Pillow — a SEPARATE `data/generals.json` `sides[side].commissionPool`, never the starting roster) into his pool for `costPolitical` political capital, after which they're appointable/promotable/seatable like any general; LOW combat OVR / HIGH political value teaches that rank ≠ competence (a commissioned Banks fields leadership 49 vs Grant 87 — the §12.3 command-politics bind made playable, capped by `maxCommissions` 3); `cmdCommission` writes ONLY `cmd.commissioned`+capital+reputation, **byte-identical until you commission** (`_cmdRosterPlusCommissioned`===the bare roster when empty — proven by a 132-cell A/B vs HEAD `8eb913a`; the 3 GM moves gate on the commissioned set so an un-commissioned officer can't sneak in); 6 citation-grade figures via a 12-agent research+verify Workflow (records honest both sides, Pillow corrected to Brig.

Gen.'s** billet in BOTH armies (any Brig. Gen. seated leads belowGrade until promoted — the Q9 synergy); **byte-identical until a division is seated** (lift 0 via the fast-path; pre-Q12 saves read identically); one billet per man, vacating a corps cascades at the READ layer (`_cmdDivClean`:795), `cmdInit` sanitizes on load, no `_SAVE_VER` bump, NO RNG; `data/ratings.json` `divisionCommand` (Inferred + 2 sources Glatthaar/Weigley); **[CODEX code + CLAUDE close-out]** — Codex finished+committed (`7b64d2e`)+pushed the sound code but ran NO bug-hunt + wrote NO docs, so the close-out ran the bug-hunt (5 finders × default-refute verify + critic invariantsHold=TRUE; 1 LOW anti-Lost-Cause-balance in the teaching copy fixed copy-only — added the Union's Hancock-II-Corps divisions) + wrote the full doc trail; `probe-command` 69/69 0 pe, `diag-classic` 346, GATE OK, HTML byte-identical to source, **no tactical file touched → 9 battles byte-identical by construction**; the strategic `load` no-regression battery env-blocked by the THREE-CDN headless stall (shares no Q12 code, all green at Q11) ✅ (D110) — **the GM moves Appoint/Relieve · Promote · Corps · Commission · Division are now all shipped**. **DEFERRED:** the full muster-roll inspect-expand / "Army Register" UI → a later UI pass (`fldMusterRollHtml` ships probe-vetted + ready); **the rest of the GM §12** — the **symmetric AI-GM** (still needs an enemy-command shadow wired to combat without breaking byte-identity / the no-fudge wall — [hard]; T15 gives it a roster to draft over), cross-theater **Transfer** (still needs authored `theater` fields — `generals.json` has none), and the §12.3 **ELECTION-SUPPORT relief-bind** for the political generals (needs the 1864-election state — pairs with the E victory/election work). Next: **the GM follow-up increment** (AI-GM + Transfer/election-bind) → the **E strategic arc** → Phase F/I/H/J → **Q5 Chattanooga + Q6 USCT battles LAST**. (DECISIONS D94–D110.) **[Context-budget rule: at ≤25% context, stop at a clean milestone + hand off — START-HERE standards / AUTONOMOUS-RUN §3 / memory.]**

### Phase J — POLISH / META
- [ ] **Saves** ‹PROPOSED per D54›: localStorage + named slots + export/import; undo-last-turn on the accessible preset.
- [ ] Mod-friendly data + shareable saves/scenarios. **Hosting DEFERRED** (GitHub Pages on request — D54).
      **Publish options when wanted (D71):** GitHub Pages (simplest for one file) OR itch.io + Butler (best indie
      discovery + in-browser play + auto-deploy); Vercel unnecessary. **$0 nuance:** Pages on a PRIVATE repo needs
      GitHub Pro — for true $0 use a public deploy repo or itch.io; rename `civil_war_generals.html`→`index.html` at publish.
- [ ] **Full-campaign playthrough probe** added to the no-regression suite (D54).

## ITEMS NEEDING YOUR CONFIRM (the last clarifications)
1. **Phase ORDER** — is A→B→C→D→E→…→H→I→J right? In particular: **strategic S3–S5 (E) vs tactical breadth/hex
   (C/D)** — which first? And does the **full hex engine (D)** really sit after tactical depth, or sooner?
   **✅ RESOLVED (D91): new v1 order = C (finish Chattanooga + USCT) → E (strategic S3–S5) → F → G → H → I → J; the full hex engine (Phase D) is DEFERRED TO v2.**
2. **B6 CS-player tactical mode** — include in v1 (command either side)? Here in Phase B, or later? *(SHIPPED — D72.)*
3. **Western theater (C2)** — fold into tactical breadth as drafted, or its own later phase?
4. **Audio (H4)** — in the come-to-life pass as drafted, or sooner? *(NOTE: `T9-audio.js` already started it under D77, ahead of Phase H.)* **✅ RESOLVED (D91): CONTINUE INCREMENTALLY now — deepen audio a little per milestone, accessible + default-off.**
5. Anything **missing** from v1, or anything here you'd **cut** to v2?

### Open design tensions to resolve (ported from the retired MASTER-TASK-LIST, sourced to D68)
6. **Loot/survival (Phase I) — D68 vs D61 tension:** D68 elevated loot/survival to an always-on "core pillar" (progression + journey mode); D61 says DEFER to after core. Resolve which governs. **✅ RESOLVED (D91): CORE PILLAR now (D68 wins) — build standalone loot + inventory + light survival + the Oregon-Trail journey mode as a built pillar, no longer deferred.**
7. **Zoomable battle scale (D68):** brigades expanding into regiments on zoom — a new tactical-engine requirement beyond the current brigade abstraction; not yet designed. **✅ RESOLVED (D91): DEFER TO v2 — keep the brigade-per-marker abstraction for v1.**
8. **Heavy embedded media (D68):** bundling PD imagery/footage into the single-file deliverable — plan the Phase-H tier/compress pipeline so portability survives (ties H1 + the D71 asset-ingestion pipeline).
9. **Deferred tooling (D54):** the `src/` subsystem folder reorg (`src/strategy/` · `src/render/` etc. — `src/tactical/` already exists), perf presets + hotpath profiling for the Intel UHD-617 floor, and a reusable historical-data layer + in-game sources codex (ties E2).
