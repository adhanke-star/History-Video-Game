# V1 FEATURE-COMPLETE CHECKLIST — "The Civil War"  (APPROVED — run-k Q&A, 2026-06-15)

**Purpose:** give "complete all project goals" a concrete, ordered target so autonomous runs can drive to a
content-complete v1 (still a perpetual project after — D54). Built from `MODERN-UGG-PLAN.md` (P0–P5),
`GRAND-STRATEGY-PLAN.md` (S2–S5), and the §8 charter systems. **Status: APPROVED** — all 12 forks across a
3-round Q&A are locked (recorded as DECISIONS **D61**). The phase order below is the roadmap for autonomous runs.

---

## OPERATING MODEL (LOCKED — run-k Q&A, 2026-06-15)
1. **Surface judgment calls.** Design/balance forks are surfaced for your approval BEFORE building; only
   mechanical/obvious continuations + the build-and-vet itself run autonomously. (Refines charter §8.3
   "decide & ship" — that applied to the all-night charter; you've now opted for design oversight.)
2. **Clear-then-continuous.** I clear a SCOPE's designs with you upfront, then execute the whole scope
   continuously (all-night style), pausing only at scope-end or when a NEW unforeseen fork appears.
3. **Per-milestone vetting + push** stays the same: GATE OK → focused probe + full no-regression + diag-classic
   + 0 pageerrors → adversarial bug-hunt (all fixed) → commit → `git push origin main`. Balance auto-tuned + logged.
4. **Content standard:** ≥2-source Verified (else Inferred), anti-Lost-Cause, period-but-tight voice.

## THE V1 CHECKLIST (proposed order — edit freely)

### Phase A — CONNECT THE TWO LAYERS  ‹✅ DONE — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D62›
- [x] **A1 Bridge conditioning into tactical:** the strategic-desk army (weapons bought, the 3 corps,
      general/leadership, morale, manpower strength) conditions the tactical battle's forces (strength /
      firepower / quality / morale / fatigue) — the owner-mode army you built actually fields in the real-time fight.
      *(`src/tactical/T2-campaign-link.js` `fldCampaignCondition`; 74-anchor ±12% identical to Classic/auto-resolve; re-arms from the loadout incl. reinforcements.)*
- [x] **A2 Tactical FREE mode:** a menu entry to launch a custom skirmish (pick side / forces / terrain) and
      to fight the Bull Run scenario from the bridge (not just the standalone demo).
      *("Fight in real time ⚔" on the bridge briefing; First Bull Run [US]→bullrun1 else a conditioned procedural fight; a "⚔ SKIRMISH" main-menu setup [side/size/ground/year/fog].)*
- [x] **A3 Result feedback loop:** the real-time battle outcome flows back into the campaign (casualties,
      ground, `enemyWill`) — substitutable for the existing Classic / auto-resolve result (MODERN-UGG §2).
      *(REAL casualty fractions from the fight → `startBattleRuntime`+`_arApplyCasualties`+`campaignAdvance`→`_t1Resolve`; win advances, loss recovers; deterministic. probe-campaign-link 16/16.)*

### Phase B — TACTICAL DEPTH  (P2–P5, real-time engine)  ‹✅ COMPLETE — B1 D64 · B2 D65 · B3 D66 · B4 D67 · B5 D70 · B6 D72 — run k, 2026-06-15/16›
- [x] **B1 Smarter ATTACKER AI** — defender-favored, fog aids the defender (LOCKED); attacker doctrinally
      sound (concentrate / assault) but the fog inversion tuned out. (Prototype exists: `ATTACKER-AI-PROPOSAL.md`.)
      *(`fldAiAttacker`: concentrate-on-weaker-flank / close / assault, GRADUAL per-unit commit [no knife-edge] + CAUTIOUS-WHEN-BLIND. Sweep: both-doctrines Bull Run fog-OFF CS 6/8, fog-ON 8/8 — fog aids the defender; def-cas 4592 vs the passive 1276. probe-ai 15/15.)*
- [x] **B2 Officers / command** — leaders with command radius + morale bonus, can be hit (ties named-generals). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D65›
      *(`src/tactical/T3-officers.js`: a command AURA [faster recovery / rally / capped rout-resistance] + an exposure→wound→fall hazard with a one-time command shock; per-leader HISTORICAL fate + risk-decay + cover so army commanders survive [10/10] and only the real casualties [Bee/Bartow] are fall-prone; ties `bridgeArmy` leadership; the real Bull Run cast in `data/bullrun.json`. Officers-ON Bull Run CS 7/8 fog-OFF · 8/8 fog-ON. probe-officers 15/15; 6 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B3 In-battle logistics** — ammo + fatigue depth + supply. ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D66›
      *(`src/tactical/T4-logistics.js`: rear ammunition trains w/ finite reserve, disengaged-resupply, out-of-ammo→bayonet on the objective, exhaustion move penalty; attacker-far/defender-near train asymmetry. **Bug-hunt caught a fog inversion** [logistics-ON inverted fog-aids-defender, CS 8/8→0/8]; surfaced to Aaron → fixed by choking the ATTACKER's resupply under fog → balance-NEUTRAL both fog states [fog-OFF CS 5/8, fog-ON CS 8/8]. Ties strategic supply + raid. probe-logistics 14/14; 7 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B4 Distinct arm roles** — artillery (canister / long-range), cavalry (scout / flank / screen / raid). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-15, DECISIONS D67›
      *(`src/tactical/T5-arms.js`: canister spike vs cover-attenuation + long-range bombardment; the ASYMMETRIC battery doctrine [defender-safe / attacker-forward-and-catchable, the lost crest guns]; the ARM melee table [art 0.35 overrun, cav 1.4 shock / 0.9 braced]; cavalry scout/flank/screen/raid [raid drains the enemy B-3 train]; the Cannon-Corps→field-battery bridge [`_fldArtProfile`: Napoleon→canister, Whitworth→long-range]. **Vetting caught a real byte-identity bug** [the base.html `ARM` melee table was live, not undefined → fixed via a base-ARM fallback when arms off] and **surfaced a stacked-balance fork** [officers+logistics+arms made clear-weather AI-vs-AI Union-favoured; Aaron's call → **First Bull Run now DEFAULTS to fog ON**, the faithful battle where fog aids the defender → live CS 8/8]. arms-only fog-OFF CS 7/8. probe-arms 23/23; 8 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B5 Difficulty/realism presets** for the AI + sim depth. **Exposes the effectiveness/realism sliders the
      TACTICAL ENGINEERING CORPS effects will key off** (the Engineering Corps stays its OWN later milestone, D69 — B5
      ships the sliders + hooks, not the corps). ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-16, DECISIONS D70›
      *(`src/tactical/T6-presets.js`: AI tier [Recruit/Regular/Veteran/Hardee] × realism bundle [Arcade/Balanced/Historian]
      + an Advanced per-lever expander, read at `fldInitSim` → `__FIELD.sev`{attrition·canister·supply·cmdShock·sight·veteran}
      + aiSkill/aiResolve/aiCushion → wires the existing B-1..B-4 knobs [mostly wiring, not new sim]. SMARTER-NOT-CHEATING,
      code-enforced: aiResolve ≤1 [never an enemy buff], the player cushion ONLY at a genuine Recruit, Hardee = sharper
      decisions not stat bonuses. **Balanced == today's shipped CS 8/8 SEED-FOR-SEED [byte-identical neutral].** Period-card
      "Command & Realism" picker + an in-battle "⚙ Settings" drawer; WCAG-AA, CVD-safe, reduceMotion, deterministic.
      Bug-hunt 76 agents → 13 confirmed + 6 critic gaps ALL fixed [drawer-Escape-tore-down-battle, picker ARIA, a
      malformed-preset clamp, the fog-scenario V-toggle wipe, …]. probe-presets 26/26; 9 baselines byte-identical.)*
- [x] **B6 CS-player tactical mode** ‹LOCKED: yes, Phase B› — command EITHER side in a battle (you defend as
      the CS, AI attacks). Makes the attacker AI (B1) player-facing. Doubles tactical replayability. ‹✅ — run k, 2026-06-16, DECISIONS D72›
      *(`src/tactical/T7-command-side.js` + seams in T0/T1/T3: `__FIELD.playerSide` authoritative [opts/skirmish/`_fldCamp().side`/US];
      the control layer + the render/HUD FOG VIEWER + the friend/foe line generalized from literal "US" to `fldPlayerSide()`; `fldBrSpec`
      flips the scenario AI flags by side [a CS player DEFENDS; attacker stays US → faces the B-1 AI]; a period side-choice card + side-aware
      briefing/objective/end-"you"-line + a player-home-edge 3D camera. **Vetting caught + fixed a CS-campaign officer/fog regression**
      [fldPlayerSide must resolve a CS campaign LIVE from G.campaign.side]; bug-hunt 52 agents → 11 confirmed + 7 critic gaps, the HIGH
      [skirmish-rematch soft-lock] + 3 MED [side-aware camera · fog-leak reinforcement cue · a render-fog probe gap] + LOW polish all fixed.
      Byte-identical for US; CS defense winnable 8/8 fog-ON; live stacked still CS 8/8. probe-csplayer 16/16; 10 baselines byte-identical.)*

### Phase C — TACTICAL BREADTH  (more real-time battles, data-driven)
- [~] **C1 Eastern marquee (IN PROGRESS):** ~~Fredericksburg~~ ✅ (D73 — the Marye's-Heights slaughter on the data-driven engine: a scenario REGISTRY + data-driven scenario UI + the gated "doomed-assault" AI posture; adding a battle is now a data file + a registry line). ~~The universal artillery gun model~~ ✅ (D75 — replaced Fredericksburg's per-battle "volume-of-fire proxy men" with a consistent gun-count/battery-weight fire model used identically in every battle; CS 8/8 + ratio 2.06 re-tuned via geometry, byte-identical baselines). ~~Antietam~~ ✅ (D76 — the FIRST MULTI-PHASE epic: a NEW gated `phases[]` engine [`src/tactical/T8-phases.js`] runs the Cornfield → the Sunken Road "Bloody Lane" → Burnside's Bridge in sequence, survivors/casualties + the running result carried forward, weighted-aggregate scoring with a draw band, a period inter-phase transition card; per-phase outcomes historically faithful, CS 2-1, the Emancipation turning point taught; byte-identical single-objective path; ‹bug-hunt to finish next session›). Remaining: Gettysburg (its 3 days = the next multi-phase) · Chancellorsville · Malvern Hill.
- [ ] **C2 Western** ‹LOCKED: Phase C, with breadth›: Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chickamauga/Chattanooga, Atlanta/the March, Franklin.
- [ ] **C3 USCT battles (1863–65):** the Crater, New Market Heights, Olustee, Nashville (the flagship teachable arc).
- [ ] **C4 Custom-battle builder** (D54).

### Phase D — FULL HEX TACTICAL ENGINE  (co-equal, selectable — LOCKED "full engine", after depth)
- [ ] **D1** A complete parallel hex/turn-based tactical mode on the modern OOB/scenario data, selectable per
      battle alongside real-time. (Legacy "Classic" hex battles stay frozen; this is a NEW, data-driven hex layer.)
      ‹LOCKED: sits here, after tactical depth, so it duplicates onto a mature engine.›

### Phase E — STRATEGIC ARC COMPLETION  (S3–S5)
- [ ] **E1 S3 alt-history:** tiered divergence + hinge forks + emergent toggle + the player-driven "your war
      vs history" tracker + divergence log (no thumb on the scale — D54).
- [ ] **E2 S4 education:** multi-axis codex + inline glossary + the full guided tutorial + play-style presets
      (President / General-Commander, + the Historian settings overlay — D39) + difficulty/realism sliders.
- [ ] **E3 S4 accessibility:** the dedicated FULL WCAG 2.2 AA pass + the 4 a11y modes (high-contrast, CVD-safe,
      SR turn/battle narration, dyslexia font) — your professional bar.
- [ ] **E4 S5 victory:** multiple honest paths incl. negotiated peace + the rich graded after-action report +
      the Reconstruction coda.

### Phase F — CONTENT SYSTEMS  (folded into the phase each best fits)
- [ ] Logistics/rail network · POW exchange-collapse · disease/medical · hard war · irregular war · the four
      under-told-perspective threads · flagship named units · CS finance toolkit · war-finance civics · a real
      diplomacy system · the human-cost-with-gravity treatment. (All from §8 D31–D41.)
- [ ] **Women in the war — soldier & relief threads (Aaron, run-k idea, 2026-06-15).** Add **female leads in the
      soldier-story rotation**, not only male: the women who enlisted **disguised as men** (est. several hundred —
      e.g. Sarah Rosetta Wakeman / "Pvt. Lyons Wakeman", Jennie Hodgers / "Albert Cashier" [served the whole war,
      drew a pension], Loreta Janeta Velázquez / "Harry T. Buford" on the CS side — frame the contested memoir as
      contested), and a **Clara Barton arc** (the "Angel of the Battlefield" → the Missing Soldiers Office → the
      American Red Cross). Neighbors: **Dr. Mary Edwards Walker** (the only woman awarded the Medal of Honor) and
      **Harriet Tubman** (scout/spy; the Combahee River Raid, 1863). Verified/anti-Lost-Cause; ties USCT (C3) +
      the human-cost treatment. ‹idea — implement when soldier-stories / the codex land; not B-4 scope›
- [ ] **Tactical Engineering Corps — units, features & effects tied to the effectiveness/realism sliders (Aaron,
      run-k directive, 2026-06-15).** Extend the strategic **Engineer Works Corps** (`src/57-engineering.js`, D43;
      `bridgeArmy(C).engineering`) onto the real-time field as a distinct arm/role (the same gated-seam pattern
      B-4 used for art/cav): **pontoon bridges** (cross a creek/river — the Bull Run terrain already has
      Young's Branch / the Stone Bridge), **field fortifications / entrenchments** (raise cover on the objective),
      **abatis / obstacles** (slow an assault), **obstacle-clearing / road & railhead repair** (restore movement).
      **The "make it make sense" requirement: these effects must INTERACT with the B-5 effectiveness/realism
      sliders** — e.g. the realism preset scales how long entrenching takes, how much cover a parapet confers,
      whether pontoons are required to cross vs. fordable, sapper speed, and how the strategic engineering rating
      gates the field corps' size/quality (the A1-bridge anchor, like B-4 wired Cannon-Corps→battery). Surface a
      concrete design when B-5 / a tactical-engineering milestone is reached. ‹idea + B-5 wiring requirement›

### Phase G — THEATERS
- [ ] Eastern (largely done) → **Western** (same mechanics, new content — D40/D54). Naval/riverine/trans-Miss DEFERRED.

### Phase H — "MAKE IT COME TO LIFE"  (graphics/footage — LOCKED: AFTER gameplay-complete)
- [ ] **H1 PD images:** weapons / flags / USCT / scenes (have 131 portraits) via LoC + Internet Archive +
      Wikimedia, linked-assets + offline fallback. **Asset-ingestion (D71):** extend `tools/build.mjs` (Node, not a
      separate script) to Base64-embed + TIER/COMPRESS media w/ offline fallback so the single file stays portable as
      it grows (D68 #7). **Guardrail (D71):** no Phase-H media lib may require `SharedArrayBuffer` (COOP/COEP headers
      can't be set on GitHub Pages; `coi-serviceworker` is the shim if ever needed). PD imagery > AI art (aesthetic / IP / anachronism).
- [ ] **H1b Brigade BADGES & INSIGNIA — the battle flags (Aaron, run-k idea, 2026-06-15).** Render each brigade's
      identity with its **battle flag / colors** on the unit badge: the various Confederate battle flags (ANV
      Southern Cross, Hardee/Polk Western patterns, the national flags), the U.S. national & regimental colors,
      and the **Army of the Potomac corps badges** (Kearny patch, the corps shapes/colors). Tasteful period
      engraving on the 2D/3D unit markers + the selected-brigade HUD; CVD-safe (shape + label, not flag-color
      alone); honor reduceMotion. Pairs with the B-4 arm markers (gun/limber + trooper) already shipped.
      ‹idea — graphics pass; not now›
- [ ] **H2 Reenactment footage** cutaways at key beats (skippable, offline→procedural fallback).
- [ ] **H3 Richer 3D/animation** on the tactical engine (reuse run-h PBR/HDRI/post-FX); period broadsheet/engraving UI throughout.
- [ ] **H4 Richer audio** ‹LOCKED: Phase H›: PD period tunes + battlefield/camp soundscapes + UI cues, all
      accessible (toggles/captions/volume), default off.

### Phase I — LOOT / SURVIVAL  (LOCKED: DEFER to after core)
- [ ] Standalone rarity-tiered loot + inventory (all modes) · light survival (rations/weather/forage/disease,
      default off) · the Oregon-Trail journey mode. All preset-gated (§27).

### Phase J — POLISH / META
- [ ] **Saves** ‹PROPOSED per D54›: localStorage + named slots + export/import; undo-last-turn on the accessible preset.
- [ ] Mod-friendly data + shareable saves/scenarios. **Hosting DEFERRED** (GitHub Pages on request — D54).
      **Publish options when wanted (D71):** GitHub Pages (simplest for one file) OR itch.io + Butler (best indie
      discovery + in-browser play + auto-deploy); Vercel unnecessary. **$0 nuance:** Pages on a PRIVATE repo needs
      GitHub Pro — for true $0 use a public deploy repo or itch.io; rename `civil_war_generals.html`→`index.html` at publish.
- [ ] **Full-campaign playthrough probe** added to the no-regression suite (D54).

## ITEMS NEEDING YOUR CONFIRM (the last clarifications)
1. **Phase ORDER** — is A→B→C→D→E→…→H→I→J right? In particular: **strategic S3–S5 (E) vs tactical breadth/hex
   (C/D)** — which first? And does the **full hex engine (D)** really sit after tactical depth, or sooner?
2. **B6 CS-player tactical mode** — include in v1 (command either side)? Here in Phase B, or later?
3. **Western theater (C2)** — fold into tactical breadth as drafted, or its own later phase?
4. **Audio (H4)** — in the come-to-life pass as drafted, or sooner?
5. Anything **missing** from v1, or anything here you'd **cut** to v2?
